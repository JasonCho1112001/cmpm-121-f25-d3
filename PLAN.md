# PLAN FOR D3.a

1. Read and understand main.ts
2. Replace main.ts with my own code
3. Set up Leaflet dependencies
4. Initialize grids to be approximately the size of a building
5. Initialize contents of a cell to have tokens (Using luck function)
6. Make the cells clickable and interactable and Make a graphic showing the contents within a cell (tokens and what value they have)
7. Make a crafting and inventory system


8. Spawn tokens in cells using the luck function (Already done in step 5)
